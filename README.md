# SVGLogoMaker
This project creates a simple logo based on user input.

This project uses nodejs modules and the inquirer.

This project will be used through CLI (launching via node index.js).
The user will be asked up to 3 character text they want the logo to contain.
The user will be be asked what color their text will be.
The user will be asked what shape (circle, triangle, square) their logo will be.
The user will be asked what color the shape will be.
A logo.svg file will be created once completed.
An index.html file will also be created (exact copy of logo.svg) since my live server isn't working to reveal the logo.svg.
A 300 X 200 pixel image will be shown.

The files included are index.js, index.html, ./lib/logo.svg, .lib/shapehtml.js, .gitignore, license, readme.md.
